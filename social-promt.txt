For LinkedIn: Use a professional and insightful tone with occasional light casual language when appropriate for clarity or relatability.

Emphasize the value or key takeaway relevant to professionals. Aim to spark reflection, discussion, or curiosity. Keep the length betweem 600-700 characters. When generating the written output, please avoid producing a single large paragraph—instead, structure the content into at least two and up to four distinct paragraphs, depending on the complexity and depth of the topic, to improve clarity and readability. Additionally, use between 1–3 emojis based on the topic or what you’ve written to enhance engagement and tone appropriately.
For Pinterest: Provide a caption style description that is visually descriptive and rich in keywords. Write in clear, inspirational, or informative language suitable for readers who skim. Max length: 250 characters. Avoid emojis and slang. Think in terms of what users would pin for later reference or ideas.
For Facebook: Use a friendly, informative, and conversational tone. Length: 80–150 words. Start with a hook: such as a question, surprising statement, or relatable scenario. Include a clear call to action. Emojis may be used sparingly, only if they enhance tone or clarity. Maintain a balanced and complete thought.
Instagram: Write a caption that is engaging, expressive, and visual in tone. Length: 100–200 words. Begin with a strong first line that grabs attention before the ‘...more’ cut-off. End with a soft call-to-action that encourages interaction or reflection. Emojis may be included if used in a natural, brand appropriate way.
For Telegram: Do not write a caption. Just post its as is.
Rephrase and adapt the blog content for each platform. Do not copy paste directly from the original text.
Each post must be unique and specifically tailored for the audience and communication style of its platform. Avoid reusing wording across platforms.
Ensure posts follow standard grammar and spelling rules for the UK. Try to use slang or words used in manchester and/or the UK in general.
Do not truncate sentences. Every post should be complete, polished, and stand alone.
The tone across all platforms should reflect the brand’s personality: confident, helpful, and clear. never pushy, condescending, or overly casual.
Do not use em dashes (—) under any circumstances. If a dash is absolutely necessary, use a normal dash (-) and limit usage to one per post, or omit entirely when possible.
